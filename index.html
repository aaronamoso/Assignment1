        <h4>About Me</h4>
        <p>I hope you are doing well! A little bit about me is that I currently am a student for Software Development
            and will be on my last year!
            Before studying full time in winter semester, I was working for lululemon remotely for about 6 months,
            learning different software that
            we could implement to further assist our clients tailoring their needs. Outside of my professional
            background, I do enjoy being out in the
            mountains or anything that has to do with nature.
